# Online Shopping System

Welcome to my project repository for the "Online Shopping System," a comprehensive solution developed as part of the Object Oriented Programming coursework at the University of Westminster.

## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate a deep understanding of object-oriented programming principles through the design and implementation of an online shopping system. The system offers a console-based interface for administrators and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for users, focusing on product management and shopping functionalities.

## Key Features

- **Product Management**: Add, delete, and list products using a console interface designed for system administrators.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Users can browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and visualize the final price, adhering strictly to the provided mock-ups.
- **Discount System**: Implements a discount logic offering a 20% discount for buying at least three products of the same category and a 10% discount for the first purchase.
- **Robust Design**: Based on object-oriented principles, featuring a well-structured class hierarchy including `Product`, `Electronics`, `Clothing`, and `User`.
- **Data Persistence**: Products are saved to and loaded from a file, ensuring data persistence across sessions.
- **Testing and Validation**: Comprehensive test plan and automated testing to ensure system reliability and robustness.

## Technologies

- **Language**: Java
- **GUI Framework**: Swing (Note: Usage of JavaFX and NetBeans Designer was prohibited)
- **Testing**: JUnit (for automated testing scenarios)

## Installation and Usage

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. The project can be imported into an IDE that supports Java and Swing, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-shopping-system.git
cd online-shopping-system
```

Run the application from the main class. Ensure that Java is correctly installed on your system.
